# Product Page FreeCodeCamp

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/nstelmach/pen/ExZGpmL](https://codepen.io/nstelmach/pen/ExZGpmL).

The goal of this project was to learn HTML and CSS. I focused on building a product landing page. I was supposed to use tags such as header, img, nav, video, form, input, and the corresponding id and classes. I also used media queries and flexbox. In the future, I plan to refactor styles into classes using the BEM naming convention, use CSS Reset and increase accessibility by adding appropriate aria labels.
